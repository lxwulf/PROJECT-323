# PROJECT-323

## What is it?

This is an experimental repository with a collection of several Ansible roles.
The most Ansible roles here works flawless only in my environment.
Despite, I try to make the roles as neutral as possible and making use of variables which
you can change with your values. There is no guarantee that this work on your side or
that these roles are useful for you.

## What is when I'm brave enough?

No one would stop you from trying. Keep in mind to look into the `var` folder of each `*-ROLE` folder
for proper configuration of the `*-ROLE` itself. Don't forget the `group_vars` folder, which you need to
make by your own, and it's not included in this repo. More information in the `*-ROLE` folders itself.
Also, you should expect to do more configuration as I need to do because I had set up it for my environment.

## What kind of environment are you talking about?

The Ansible roles are created for the PROJECT-323, which is the previous name, for development.
It is a special server environment for managing various virtual servers and instances of services,
such as containers, cloud storage or developer environments.

## Why are you so cryptic with your description?

The time of reveal will come, but it's not yet ready for it, so please be patient.
